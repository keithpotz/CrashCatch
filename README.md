CrashCatch is a lightweight, single-header C++ crash-reporting library for generating `.dmp` and `.txt` crash logs — complete with stack traces, diagnostics, optional cleanup hooks, and user dialogs.

---

## 🎯 Overview

CrashCatch provides simple and powerful crash diagnostics for C++ applications on **Windows and Linux**, with macOS support planned. Whether you're building GUI apps, system tools, or CLI utilities, CrashCatch helps you catch and log critical failures with minimal setup.

CrashCatch currently supports **Windows** (via `MiniDumpWriteDump`) and **Linux** (via POSIX signals and `backtrace()`) for generating crash reports.  
**macOS support** is planned for a future release.


---

## 🚀 Key Features

- ✅ Cross-platform design: Windows (available), Linux/macOS (planned)
- 🔹 Single-header C++ integration
- 💥 Stack trace on unhandled exceptions
- 💥 **Signal/Exception Capture** – Handles `SIGSEGV`, `SIGABRT`, `SIGFPE` (Linux), unhandled exceptions (Windows)
- 🧠 Automatic `.dmp` + `.txt` crash report generation
- 🔍 **Symbol Resolution** – Demangled symbol output (Linux), top frame names (Windows)
- 📋 Self-diagnostics in plain-text (version, uptime, config, etc.)
- 🧼 Minimal setup: drop-in header or one-liner initialization
- ⚙️ Configurable: version tagging, notes, message box, cleanup
- 🛡️ Future-ready: secure upload, anonymization, viewer app
- 🧪 Debug & release support
- 🧵 Symbol resolution for top stack frames (x86 / x64 aware)

## 🔧 Installation
CrashCatch is 100% header-only.

To integrate:

1. Copy `include/CrashCatch.hpp` into your project
2. Add `#include "CrashCatch.hpp"` in your code
3. (Optional) Use `CrashCatch::enable()` or the `CRASHCATCH_AUTO_INIT` macro
4. For Linux inlcude `-ldl` or `-rdynamic` for deeper Linux symbole resolution if desired

> ✅ No build steps.  
> ❌ No `.lib`, `.dll`, or `.so`.  
> 🔒 Just one `.hpp` file, ready to use.

Copy `CrashCatch.hpp` into your project and include it:

```cpp
#include "CrashCatch.hpp"

## QuickStart
### Zero Config (Auto-init)
```cpp
#define CRASHCATCH_AUTO_INIT
#include "CrashCatch.hpp"

int main(){
    int* ptr = nullptr;
    *ptr = 42; // simulated crash
}
```
### One-Liner Initialization
```cpp
#include "CrashCatch.hpp"
int main(){
    CrashCatch::enable(); //Initalizes with default config

    int* ptr = nullptr;
    *ptr = 42; // simulated crash
}
```
### Full Configuration
```cpp
#include "CrashCatch.hpp"

int main(){
    CrashCatch::Config config:
    config.appVersion = "1.0.0";
    config.buildConfig = "Release";
    config.additionalNotes = "This is a test build.";
    config.onCrash = []{
        std::cout << "Cleaning up before crash...\n"/
    };
    config.showCrashDialog = true;

    CrashCatch::initalize(config);

    int* ptr = nullptr;
    *ptr = 42; // simulated crash
}
```

## 📄 Crash Output

When a crash occurs, CrashCatch generates the following files in the `./crash_dumps/` directory:

- `crash_YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS.dmp` — Binary MiniDump (viewable in tools like WinDbg)
- `crash_YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS.txt` — Human-readable crash summary

### 📋 Example `.txt` Includes:

```text
